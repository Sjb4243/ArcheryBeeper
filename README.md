Archery Timer System ðŸŽ¯

This is an automated timer system designed for use in archery clubs, as the systems you can buy are prohibitively expensive, so this works as a basic version. Simply hook up to a monitor with a long cable and you'll be good to go. 

To use (key presses): <br>
1 - Initiates one shooting cycle <br>
2 - Initiates two shooting cycles <br>
c - Starts the collection process <br>
d - Changes the current shooting detail <br>
Esc - Exits the current process (can be used for FAST or when people finish shooting)

Installation instructions: <br>
Download Python <br>
Run "pip install pygame" <br>
Download script <br>
Place an MP3 file in the same folder as the script, this will be your shooting sound.
